\title{Comparison circuit over $\mathbb{F}_{p^d}$}

\begin{document}
\maketitle

We want to compare two vectors $X=(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_\ell)$ and $Y=(y_1,y_2,\ldots,y_\ell)\in\mathbb{F}_{p^d}^\ell$ for the lexicographical order $<_L$:

$$X <_L Y \Leftrightarrow \exists i\in[1,\ell] \text{ such that } x_i < y_i \text{ and } \forall j\leq i ~~ x_j = y_j $$

where $x<y$ compare $x$ and $y$ as if they were elements of $[0,p^d-1]$. Let us assume that we can compute the logical gates $<$ and $=$ over $\mathbb{F}_{p^d}$, then we can evaluate the lexicographical order $<_L$ as: 

$$ X <_L Y = \sum_{i=1}^\ell \left( (x_i < y_i).\prod_{j=1}^{i-1} (x_i = y_j) \right)$$

We can evaluate the term $\prod_{j=1}^{i-1} (x_i = y_j)$ using the randomized vector equality testing with a depth independant of $i$. We are left with evaluating $<$ over $\mathbb{F}_q$ for $q=p^d$ whose truth table is given hereafter:

$$
\begin{array}{c|ccccc}
  < & 0 & 1 & 2 & \cdots & q-1 \\
  \hline
  0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & \cdots & 1 \\
  1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & \cdots & 1 \\
  2 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \cdots & 1 \\
  \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
  q-1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \cdots & 0 \\
\end{array}
$$

Therefore it can be evaluated as:

\begin{align*}
  x < y & = \sum_{i=0}^{q-2} \left( (x = i)\cdot \prod_{j=0}^i (y \neq j) \right) \\
        & = \sum_{i=0}^{q-2} \left( (x = i)\cdot \sum_{j=i+1}^{q-1} (y = j) \right) \\
\end{align*}

We denote the function $f: \mathbb{F}_q \rightarrow \mathbb{F}_q$ defined by $f(x) = x^{q-1}$ which is equal to $0$ if $x = 0$ and $1$ otherwise, thus we have $(x = j) = 1-f(x-j)$. As a consequence we can write $<$ as:

$$ x < y = \sum_{i=0}^{q-2} \left( (1-f(x-i)) \cdot \sum_{j=i+1}^{q-1} (1 - f(y-j)) \right) $$

Suppose we have two ciphertexts encrypting the vectors of length $q-1$ (can be of length $k\geq q-1$ with $0$s padding) $(x,0,\ldots,0)$ and $(y,0,\ldots,0)$ in an SIMD fashion. We can obtain ciphertexts encrypting $(x,x,\ldots, x)$ and $(y,y,\ldots, y)$ with $2\log_2(q-1)\texttt{Rot}$ and $2\log_2(q-1)\texttt{Add}$. 

From there we can obtain encryptions of $(x,x-1,\ldots, x-q-2)$ and $(y-1,y-2,\ldots, y-q-1)$ with $2\texttt{Add}$. We can apply $f$ to these vectors in parallel with a depth of $\log (p-1) + \log d$ for a cost of $2(\log (p-1) + wt(p-1) + d - 2) \texttt{Mult}$. This can be minimized by choosing $p = 2^d + 1$ for some $d$.

With $2$ more $\texttt{Sub}$ we obtain encryptions of $(1-f(x), 1-f(x-1), \ldots, 1-f(x-q-2))$ and $(1-f(y-1), 1-f(y-2), \ldots, 1-f(y-q-1))$. From there we can get an ecryption of the different partial sums in $\log_2(q-1)\texttt{Rot}$, $\log_2(q-1)\texttt{Select}$ and $\log_2(q-1)\texttt{Add}$. The algorithm works as follow:

From there we just have to compute the scalar product of the two vectors with $1\texttt{Mult} + \log_2(q-1)\texttt{Rot} + \log_2(q-1)\texttt{Add}$. \newline

So overall we can compute $<$ over $\mathbb{F_q}$ for $q = p^d$ in:

\begin{itemize}
\item $4\log_2 (q-1) \texttt{Rot}$
\item $(4\log_2 (q-1) + 4) \texttt{Add}$
\item $(2(\log (p-1) + wt(p-1) + d - 2) + 1) \texttt{Mult}$
\item $(\log_2 (q-1) + 1) \texttt{Select}$
\end{itemize}
