abstract="The main bottleneck affecting the efficiency of all known fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) schemes is Gentry's bootstrapping procedure, which is required to refresh noisy ciphertexts and keep computing on encrypted data. Bootstrapping in the latest implementation of FHE, the HElib library of Halevi and Shoup (Crypto 2014), requires about six minutes. We present a new method to homomorphically compute simple bit operations, and refresh (bootstrap) the resulting output, which runs on a personal computer in just about half a second. We present a detailed technical analysis of the scheme (based on the worst-case hardness of standard lattice problems) and report on the performance of our prototype implementation.",

abstract="We suggest a method to construct a homomorphic encryption scheme for approximate arithmetic. It supports an approximate addition and multiplication of encrypted messages, together with a new rescaling procedure for managing the magnitude of plaintext. This procedure truncates a ciphertext into a smaller modulus, which leads to rounding of plaintext. The main idea is to add a noise following significant figures which contain a main message. This noise is originally added to the plaintext for security, but considered to be a part of error occurring during approximate computations that is reduced along with plaintext by rescaling. As a result, our decryption structure outputs an approximate value of plaintext with a predetermined precision.",
