\subsection{Notations}
  Vectors will be written in column form and denoted by boldface lower-case letters. 
  The set of integers $\{\ell,\ldots,k\}$ is denoted by $[\ell,k]$.
  For a non-negative integer $a$, let $\texttt{wt}(a)$ be the Hamming weight of its binary expansion. We denote the set of residue classes modulo $p$ by $\Z_p$ and the class representatives of $\Z_p$ are taken from the half-open interval $[-p/2, p/2)$.

\subsection{Comparison of integers with finite fields operations}
  Let $\S$ be a totally ordered set with a binary relation $<$.
  For any $x,y \in \S$, we can define the less-than and the equality functions as follows.
  \begin{align*}
    \LT_\S(x,y) = 
    \begin{cases}
      1, & \text{if } x < y; \\
      0, & \text{if } x \ge y, \\
    \end{cases}
    \\
    \EQ_\S(x,y) = 
    \begin{cases}
      1, & \text{if } x = y; \\
      0, & \text{if } x \neq y. \\
    \end{cases}
  \end{align*}
  %In our case, $\S$ is a set of consecutive integers.

\subsubsection{Functions over finite fields}\label{subsec:funcff}
The map defined by $\princhar: x \mapsto x^{p^d-1}$ from $\F_{p^d}$ to the binary set $\{0,1\}$ is called the \emph{principal character}. 
According to Euler's theorem, it returns $1$ if $x$ is non-zero and $0$ otherwise. 
%It can thus be used to compute the equality function:
%\begin{align*}
%  \EQ_{\F_{p^d}}(x,y) = 1 - \princhar (x-y).
%\end{align*}
%Moreover, note that since:
%\begin{align}\label{eq:exp_frob}
%  a^{p^d-1} = a^{(p-1)(p^{d-1} + \dots + 1)} = \prod_{i=0}^{d-1} \left(a^{p-1}\right)^{p^i},
%\end{align}
%$\chi$ can be computed with Frobenius maps ($x \mapsto x^p$) and multiplications.
Using the principal character, every function from $\F_{p^d}^l$ to $\F_{p^d}$ can be interpolated by a unique polynomial according to the following well-know lemma. 
\begin{lemma}\label{lem:interpolation}
  Every function $f: \F_{p^d}^l \rightarrow \F_{p^d}$ is a polynomial function represented by a unique polynomial $P_f(X_1,\dots,X_{l})$ of degree at most $p^d - 1$ in each variable.
  In particular,
  \begin{align*}
    P_f(X_1,\dots,X_{l}) = \sum_{\va \in \F^l_{p^d}} f(\va) \prod_{i=1}^{l} \left(1 - \princhar(X_i - a_i)\right)\,.
  \end{align*}
  where $a_i$ is the $i$th coordinate of vector $\va$. 
\end{lemma}

\subsubsection{Comparison of integers}
  Let $\F_{p^d} = \F_p[X]/\ideal{f(X)}$ for some irreducible monic polynomial $f(X)$ of degree $d$.
  Let $d'\leq d$ and $\S \subseteq [0,p^{d'}-1]$, we can map $\S$ into $\F_{p^d}$ by using the decomposition of integers in base $p$:
  $$\begin{array}{cccc}
      \iota_p : & \S & \rightarrow & \F_{p^d}\,, \\
              & \displaystyle\sum_{i=0}^{d'-1}a_ip^i & \mapsto & \displaystyle\sum_{i=0}^{d'-1}a_i X^{i-1}\,. 
    \end{array}$$
  Note that the map $\iota_p$ is injective and gives a one-to-one correspondence between $\S$ and $\F_{p^{d}}$ when $d'=d$ and $\S = [0,p^d-1]$. 
  Therefore, we identify integers belonging to $\S$ with their image by $\iota_p$ and thus omit $\iota_p$ when the situation is clear from the context.

  Let $a,b \in \S$ be two integers to be compared and $\sum_{i=0}^{d'-1} a_i X^i$ and $\sum_{i=0}^{d'-1} b_i X^i$ with $a_i, b_i \in \F_p$ are their respective encodings into $\F_{p^d}$.
  The order of the set $\S$ induces a polynomial function in $\F_{p^d}$, which can be interpolated by Lemma~\ref{lem:interpolation}.
  However, since $\LT_\S(0,y) = 1$ for any non-zero $y \in \F_{p^d}$ and zero otherwise, we obtain $\LT_\S(0,y) = \chi(y)$.
  Hence, the total degree of the interpolation polynomial is at least $p^d-1$, 
  which might be prohibitive in practice.

  Tan et al.~\cite{TLWRK20} proposed an alternative approach where $\S = [0,p-1]$.
  If input integers $a$ and $b$ belong to $\S$, the result of $\LT_\S$(a,b) is computed with its interpolation polynomial over $\F_p$.  
  If $a,b$ are larger, e.g. $a,b \in [0,p^{d'-1}]$, they are encoded into $\F_{p^d}$ as above, but their comparison is performed via the lexicographic order defined on $\F_p^{d'}$.
  This method is based on the extraction of coefficients $a_i, b_i \in \F_p$ thanks to the following result from the theory of finite fields (see \cite[Theorem 2.24]{LN86} for the proof).
  \begin{lemma}\label{lem:extraction}
    The linear transformations from $\F_{p^d}$ to $\F_p$ are exactly the mappings $L_{\alpha}(x) = \Tr_{\F_{p^d}/\F_p}(\alpha x)$ for some $\alpha \in \F_{p^d}$.
    Furthermore, $L_{\alpha} \ne L_{\beta}$ if $\alpha \ne \beta$.
  \end{lemma}
  This lemma implies that for any $i \in [0,d'-1]$ there exist $\alpha_i \in \F_{p^d}$ such that $L_{\alpha_i}(a) = a_i$ for any $a$ from the vector subspace $\F_p^{d'}$ of $\F_{p^d}$.
  Such $\alpha_i$'s can be computed by solving the following system of equations over $\F_{p^d}$ 
  \begin{align*}
    \mX \mA
    =
    \mI_{d}
  \end{align*}
  where
  \begin{align*}
  \mX &= \begin{pmatrix}
      1       & 1       & \dots   & 1             \\
      x       & x^p     & \dots   & x^{p^{d-1}}   \\
      \vdots  & \vdots  & \ddots  & \vdots        \\
      x^{d-1}     & x^{(d-1)p}    & \dots   & x^{(d-1)p^{d-1}}  \\
    \end{pmatrix}\,,
    \\
    \mA &= \begin{pmatrix}
      \alpha_0      & \alpha_1      & \dots   & \alpha_{d-1}      \\
      \alpha_0^{p}  & \alpha_1^{p}  & \dots   & \alpha_{d-1}^{p}  \\
      \vdots        & \vdots        & \ddots  & \vdots            \\
      \alpha_0^{p^{d-1}}  & \alpha_1^{p^{d-1}}  & \dots   & \alpha_{d-1}^{p^{d-1}}  \\
    \end{pmatrix}
  \end{align*}
  and $\mI_d \in \F_{p^d}^{d \times d}$ is the identity matrix.
  Hence, the $i$th column of $\inv{\mX}$ contain the powers $\alpha_i, \alpha_i^p, \dots, \alpha_i^{p^{d-1}}$, which define the linear map $L_{\alpha_i}$.

  Given the input encodings $\sum_{i=0}^{d'-1} a_i X^i$ and $\sum_{i=0}^{d'-1} b_i X^i$, we can extract and then compare their vectors of coefficients $\bm{a} = (a_0,a_1,\ldots,a_{d'-1})$ and $\bm{b} = (b_0,b_1,\ldots,b_{d'-1}) \in \F_p^{d'}$ using the lexicographical order $\bm{<}$ on $\F_{p}^{d'}$ defined by
   \begin{align*}
      \bm{a} \bm{<} \bm{b} \Leftrightarrow \exists i\in[0,d'-1] \text{ such that } & a_i < b_i \text{ and } \\
       & a_j = b_j ~~ \forall j > i \,.
    \end{align*}
    The corresponding less-than function is equal to
    \begin{align*}
      \LT_{\S^{d'}}(\bm{a}, \bm{b}) = \sum_{i=0}^{d'-1} \LT_{\S}(a_{i}, b_{i}) \prod_{j=i+1}^{d'-1} \EQ_{\S}(a_{j}, b_{j})\,,
    \end{align*}
    whereas the equality function is defined by
    \begin{align*}
      \EQ_{\S^{d'}}(\bm{a}, \bm{b}) = \prod_{i=0}^{d'-1} \EQ_{\S}(a_{i}, b_{i})\,,
    \end{align*}
    Notice that the above construction is generic for any set $\S$ embedded into $\F_p$.
    For example, if $\S = [0,s-1]$ for some $s < p$, then one can encode input integers via decomposition in base $s$ and compare them using $\LT_{\S^{d'}}$.
  %This function requires $d'$ evaluations of $\LT_{\F_{p}}$ which has degree at most $p-1$, $d'-1$ evaluations of $\EQ_{\F_{p}}$ which has also degree $p-1$ and $2d'-1$ additional multiplications.
  %Thus, if we ignore the complexity of digit extraction, the total complexity of comparing elements of $\F_{p}^{d'}$ in terms of multiplications is $O(d'(p-1))$.

\subsubsection{Comparison of large integers}\label{sec:comparison_of_large_integers}
When the size of input integers exceeds $|\S|^d$, we can decompose integers in base $|\S|^{d'}$ and then compare their vectors of digits using the lexicographical order $\bm{<}$ on $\left(\F_{p}^{d'}\right)^l$, for some $d' \le d$.
In fact, we compute two lexicographical orders on top of each other.

Let $a,b \in [0, |\S|^{ld'}-1]$ be input integers. 
We represent an integer $a = \sum_{i=0}^l a_i |\S|^{id'}$ by the vector $\va=(\bm{a}_0,\bm{a}_1,\ldots,\bm{a}_{l-1}) \in \left(\F_{p}^{d'}\right)^l$ of its digits of length $l$. 
The comparison of two integers $a$ and $b$ is thus equivalent to the comparison of their vector of digits $\va=(\bm{a}_0,\bm{a}_1,\ldots,\bm{a}_{l-1})$ and $\vb=(\bm{b}_0,\bm{b}_1,\ldots,\bm{b}_{l-1})$ using the lexicographical order $\bm{<}$ on $\left(\F_{p}^{d'}\right)^l$ defined as follows
    \begin{align*}
      \va \bm{<} \vb \Leftrightarrow \exists i\in[0,l-1] \text{ such that } & \bm{a}_i < \bm{b}_i \text{ and } \\
      & \bm{a}_j = \bm{b}_j ~~ \forall j > i\,.
    \end{align*}
  As done in~\cite{TLWRK20}, we can employ $\EQ_{\S^{d'}}$ and $\LT_{\S^{d'}}$ to compute the corresponding less-than function $\LT(\va, \vb)$ as follows
  \begin{align}\label{eq:general_lex_order}
    \LT(\va, \vb) = \sum_{i=0}^{l-1} \LT_{\S^{d'}}(\bm{a}_{i}, \bm{b}_{i}) \prod_{j=i+1}^{l-1} \EQ_{\S^{d'}}(\bm{a}_{j}, \bm{b}_{j}).
  \end{align}
  %Notice that the multiplicative depth of this function depends essentially of the products of the equality functions.
  %In fact, these products compare subvectors $\va_i = (\bm{a}_i, \bm{a}_{i+1},\dots,\bm{a}_{k-1})$ and $\vb_i = (\bm{b}_i, \bm{b}_{i+1},\dots,\bm{b}_{k-1})$ for $i \in [1,l-1]$.
  %Thus, we can rewrite $\LT$ as:
  %\begin{align}\label{eq:general_lex_order}
  %  \LT(\va, \vb) = \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} \LT_{\F_{p}^{d'}}(\bm{a}_{i},\bm{b}_{i}) \EQ_{\F_{p}^{d'}}(\va_{i+1}, \vb_{i+1}) 
  %\end{align}
  %with the equality function $\EQ_{\F_{p}^{d'}}(\va_{i+1}, \vb_{i+1})$ that returns $1$ if $\va_{i+1} = \vb_{i+1}$ and $0$ otherwise.
  % As shown in~\todo{cite our work}, this function can be realized by a constant-depth circuit in the following way.
  % \begin{align}\label{eq:rand_eq_circuit}
  %   \EQ_{\F_\fieldcard, e}(\vx_{i+1},\vy_{i+1}) = 1 - \princhar_{\fieldcard^e}\left(\sum_{j=i+1}^{\ell-1} r_j (x_j - y_j)\right)
  % \end{align}
  % where $r_j$ are uniformly random elements from $\F_{\fieldcard^e}$.
  % This circuit is false-biased with error probability $\fieldcard^{-e}$.
  % We can compute all $\EQ_{\F_\fieldcard, e}(\vx_{i+1},\vy_{i+1})$ using the same number of multiplications as for the single equality using Algorithm~\ref{alg:vector_equalities_circuit}.\todo{What is the complexity?}


%If $\S$ is a complete set of representatives of a finite field $\F_{p^d}$, then the equality function can be easily realized using the principal character of $\F_{p^d}$, namely $\EQ_\S(x,y) = 1 - \princhar_{p^d}(x-y)$.
% Since this function is independent of the choice of $\S$, we can write
% \begin{align*}
%   \EQ_{\F_{p^d}}(x,y) = 1 - \princhar_\fieldcard(x-y).
% \end{align*}
% Unfortunately, the comparison function is not as simple and we have to rely on Lagrange interpolation (Lemma \ref{lem:interpolation}) to compute it. Yet, there are two different ways to evaluate it: either interpolate $\LT_\S$ as a bivariate function over $\S^2$  -- i.e. compute $\LT_\S(x,y)$ -- or transform it as a univariate function in $z=x-y$ -- i.e. compute $\LT_\S(x-y,0)$.

% While the second approach might seems simpler, it requires nonetheless to be able to distinguish between ``postive'' and ``negative'' values. This means that if $\S = [0,p']$ for some $p'\geq 1$, since the values of $z = x-y$ can range within the interval $[-p',p']$, it requires to use a plaintext modulus $p\geq 2p'+1$ while being only able to use ``half'' of it.  


\subsection{Homomorphic Encryption}
We are interested in homomorphic encryption schemes that support SIMD operations on their plaintexts. 
This section aims at giving the necessary background regarding these schemes.

\subsubsection{Cyclotomic fields and Chinese Remainder Theorem}\label{subsec:crt}

Let $m$ be a positive integer and $n = \varphi(m)$ where $\varphi$ is Euler's totient function. 
Let $\mathcal{K} = \Q(\zeta_{m})$ be the cyclotomic number field constructed by adjoining a primitive $m$-th root of unity $\zeta_{m}\in\C$ to the field of rational numbers. 
The ring of integers of $\mathcal{K}$, denoted by $\intring$, is isomorphic to $\Z[X]/\ideal{\Phi_m(X)}$ where $\Phi_m(X)$ is the $m$-th cyclotomic polynomial. 
Let $p>1$ be a prime number coprime to $m$, then $\Phi_m(X)$ splits modulo $p$ into $\ell$ irreducible factors of same degree $d$, i.e. $\Phi_m(X) = F_1(X)\cdots F_\ell(X) \bmod p$. 
The degree $d$ is actually the order of $p$ modulo $m$, and $\ell = n/d$. 
The \ac{CRT} states that in this case the following ring isomorphism holds:
\begin{align*}
  \intring_p &= \Z_p[X]/\ideal{\Phi_m(X)} \nonumber \\ 
  & \cong \Z_p[X]/\ideal{F_1(X)} \times \ldots \times \Z_p[X]/\ideal{F_{\ell}(X)}
\end{align*}
For each $i \in [1,\ell]$ the quotient ring $\Z_p[X]/\ideal{F_i(X)}$ is isomorphic to the finite field $\F_{p^d}$. 
Hence, the above isomorphism can be rewritten as $\intring_p \cong \F_{p^d}^\ell$.
We call every copy of $\F_{p^d}$ in this direct product a \emph{slot}. 
Therefore, every element of $\intring_p$ contains $\ell$ slots, which implies that an array of $\ell$ independent $\F_{p^d}$-elements can be encoded as a unique element of $\intring_p$. 
The slot isomorphic to $\Z_p[X]/\ideal{F_i(X)}$ is referred to as the \emph{$i$th} slot.

Additions and multiplications of $\intring_p$-elements results in the corresponding coefficient-wise operations of their respective slots. 
In other words, each ring operation on $\intring_p$ is applied to every slot in parallel, which resembles the Single-Instruction Multiple-Data (SIMD) instructions used in parallel computing.
Therefore, the above encoding method from $\F_{p^d}^\ell$ to $\intring_p$ is often called the \emph{SIMD packing}.

%Using multiplication, we can easily define a projection map $\proj_i$ on $\intring_p$ that sends $a \in \intring_p$ encoding slots $(m_0, \dots, m_{\ell-1})$ to $\pi_i(a)$ encoding $(0, \dots, m_i, \dots, 0)$.
%In particular, $\proj_i(a) = a g_i$, where $g_i \in \intring_t$ encodes $(0 \dots, 1, \dots, 0)$.
%We can generalize this projection for any $I \subseteq \{1,\dots,\ell\}$ to $\proj_I(a) = a g_I$ with $g_I \in \intring_p$ encoding $1$ in the SIMD slots indexed by $I$.\newline

%The field $\numfield = \Q(\zeta_{m})$ is a Galois extension and its Galois group $\mathcal{G} = \Gal{(\numfield/\Q)}$ is isomorphic to $\Z_m^\times$  through: $i \mapsto (\sigma_i: X \mapsto X^i)$ where $i \in \Z_m^\times$. 
%The automorphism $\sigma_p$ corresponding to $p$ is called \emph{the Frobenius automorphism} and generates the Galois group $\Gal{(\F_{p^d}/\F_p)}$ of each slot. 
%This means that $\mathcal{F} = \ideal{\sigma_p} \subset \mathcal{G}$ partitions the roots of $\Phi_m$  into $\ell$ sets $S_i$ of $d$ elements, each set corresponding to the roots of a factor $F_i$ over $\C$. 
%Therefore, the group $\mathcal{H} = \mathcal{G}/\mathcal{F}$ acts transitively on a set of representatives $\bar{S}_i$ of each $S_i$ and thus maps $\bar{S}_i$ to $\bar{S}_j$. 
%In other words, the elements of $\mathcal{H}$ permute the SIMD slots. 
%However, the order of $\mathcal{H}$ is $n/d = \ell$, which is less than $\ell!$, the number of all possible permutations of the $\ell$ SIMD slots. 
%Nonetheless, it was shown in~\cite{GHS12} that every permutation of SIMD slots can be realized by combination of automorphisms from $\mathcal{H}$, projection maps and additions.

The HE schemes that support SIMD packing and \emph{exact} computations over encrypted data include $\BGV$~\cite{BGV12} and $\FV$~\cite{FV12}. 
These schemes have a common framework described below.

\subsubsection{Basic setup}

Let $\lambda$ be the security level of an HE scheme.
Let $L$ be the maximal multiplicative depth of homomorphic circuits we want to evaluate.
Let $d$ be the order of the plaintext modulus $p$ modulo the order $m$ of $\intring$.
Assume that the plaintext space $\intring_p$ has $\slots$ SIMD slots, i.e. $\intring_p \cong \F^\ell_{p^d}$.
% For a vector $\va \in \F^k_{p^d}$, we denote the plaintext encoding of $\va$ by $\pt(\va)$. 
The basic part of any HE schemes consists of key generation, encryption and decryption algorithms.

$\KeyGen(1^\lambda, 1^L) \rightarrow (\sk, \pk)$. Given $\lambda$ and $L$, this function outputs the secret key $\sk$ and the public key $\pk$.
%Note that the public key contains special key-switching keys that help to transform ciphertexts encrypted under other secret keys back to ciphertexts encrypted under $\sk$. 

$\Encrypt(\pt \in \intring_p, \pk) \rightarrow \ct$. The encryption algorithm takes a plaintext $\pt$ and the public key $\pk$ and outputs a ciphertext $\ct$.

$\Decrypt(\ct, \sk) \rightarrow \pt$. The decryption algorithm takes a ciphertext $\ct$ and the secret key $\sk$ and returns a plaintext $\pt$.
For freshly encrypted ciphertexts, the decryption correctness means that $\Decrypt(\Encrypt(\pt, \pk), \sk) = \pt$. 


\subsubsection{Homomorphic operations}

The homomorphic addition (multiplication) algorithm takes two input ciphertexts $\ct_1$ and $\ct_2$ encrypting plaintexts $\pt_1$ and $\pt_2$ respectively.
It outputs a ciphertext $\ct$ that encrypts the sum (product) of these plaintexts in the ring $\intring_p$.
It implies that homomorphic addition (multiplication) sums (multiplies) respective SIMD slots of $\pt_1$ and $\pt_2$.
Similar operations between ciphertexts and plaintexts are defined as well.  

%As shown in Section~\ref{subsec:crt}, the projection map $\proj_I$ can select the SIMD slots indexed by a set $I \subseteq \{0,\dots,\slots-1\}$ and set the rest to zero.
%This functionality is homomorphically realized by the $\Select$ function.

%$\Select(\ct, I) = \MulPlain(\ct, \pt(\1_I)) \rightarrow \ct'$ where $\1_I$ is a vector having $1$'s in the coordinates indexed by a set $I$ and zeros everywhere else.
%Given a ciphertext $\ct$ encrypting SIMD slots $\vm = (m_0,m_1,\dots,m_{\slots-1})$ and a set $I$, this function returns a ciphertext $\ct'$ that encrypts $\vm' = (m'_0,\dots,m'_{\slots-1})$ such that $m'_i = m_i$ if $i \in I$ and $m'_i = 0$ otherwise.

%\subsubsection{Special operations}\label{subsec:special_operations}

%One can also homomorphically permute the SIMD slots of a given ciphertext and act on them with the Frobenius automorphism. 

%$\Rotate(\ct, i) \rightarrow \ct'$ with $i \in [0, \slots-1]$. Given a ciphertext $\ct$ encrypting SIMD slots 
%$$\vm = (m_0,m_1,\dots,m_{\slots-1}),$$
%the rotation algorithm returns a ciphertext $\ct'$ that encrypts the cyclic shift of $\vm$ by $i$ positions, namely $(m_i,m_{(i+1) \mod \slots},\dots,m_{(i-1) \mod \slots})$.

%$\Frob(\ct, i) \rightarrow \ct'$ with $i\in[0,d-1]$. Given a ciphertext $\ct$ encrypting SIMD slots $\vm$ as above, the Frobenius algorithm returns a ciphertext $\ct'$ that encrypts a Frobenius map action on $\vm$, namely $(m^{p^i}_0,m^{p^i}_1,\dots,m^{p^i}_{\slots-1})$.

%As discussed in Section~\ref{subsec:funcff}, the $\Frob$ and $\Mul$ operations can be combined to compute the principal character $\princhar$, which turns non-zero values of SIMD slots into $1$ and leaves slots with zeros unchanged.

%$\IsNonZero(\ct) \rightarrow \ct'$. Given a ciphertext $\ct$ encrypting SIMD slots $\vm = (m_0,m_1,\dots,m_{\slots-1})$, this function returns a ciphertext $\ct'$ that encrypts:
%\[
%  (\princhar(m_0), \princhar(m_1), \dots, \princhar(m_{\slots-1})).
%\]
% Kim et al.~\cite{TDSC:KLLW16} showed that one can employ the Frobenius map to decrease the multiplicative depth of $\IsNonZero$.
%Recall that $\princhar(m) = m^{p^d-1} = \prod_{i=0}^{d-1} (m^{p-1})^{p^i}$ as shown in~(\ref{eq:exp_frob}).
%The multiplicative depth of $x^{p-1}$ is equal to $\ceil{\log_2 (p-1)}$.
%The multiplicative depth of $x^{p^i}$ is zero as it can be done by the $\Frob$ operation.
%In total, $d-1$ $\Frob$ operations are needed to compute $\princhar(m)$.
%As a result, the total multiplicative depth of $\IsNonZero$ is
%\begin{align}\label{eq:nonzero_depth}
%  \ceil{\log_2 (p-1)} + \ceil{\log_2 d}.
%\end{align}
%Using general exponentiation by squaring, $x^{p-1}$ requires $\floor{\log_2 (p-1)} + \wt(p-1) - 1$ field multiplications.
%Since $d-1$ field multiplications are needed to compute $\prod_{i=0}^{d-1} (x^{p-1})^{p^i}$, the total number of multiplications to compute $\princhar(m)$ is:
%\begin{align}\label{eq:nonzero_width}
%  \floor{\log_2 (p-1)} + \wt(p-1) + d - 2.
%\end{align} 

Every homomorphic ciphertext contains a special component called \emph{noise} that is removed during decryption.
However, the decryption function can deal only with noise of small enough magnitude; otherwise, this function fails.
This noise bound is defined by encryption parameters in a way that larger parameters result in a larger bound.
The ciphertext noise increases after every homomorphic operation and, therefore, approaches its maximal possible bound.
It implies that to reduce encryption parameters one needs to avoid homomorphic operations that significantly increase the noise.
Therefore, while designing homomorphic circuits, we need to take into account not only the running time of homomorphic operations but also their effect on the noise.  

%Table~\ref{table:he_operations} summarizes the running time and the noise cost of the aforementioned homomorphic operations.
%Similar to~\cite{C:HalSho14}, we divide the operations into expensive, moderate and cheap.
%The expensive operations dominate the cost of a homomorphic circuit.
%The moderate operations are less important, but if there are many of them in a circuit, their total cost can dominate the total cost.
%The cheap operations are the least important and can be omitted in the cost analysis.
The most expensive homomorphic operation with relation to both noise and running time is ciphertext-ciphertext multiplication ($\Mul$).
This operations takes place when two expressions containing input values are multiplied.
Such multiplication is called \emph{non-scalar}.
In contrast, ciphertext-plaintext multiplication ($\MulPlain$) is used when an expression with input values is multiplied by an unencrypted or publicly known value.
This is a \emph{scalar} multiplication.
Since $\Mul$ is much more expensive than $\MulPlain$, the multiplicative depth and complexity of a homomorphic circuit is usually calculated with relation to the number of $\Mul$'s, or non-scalar multiplications.
Thus, in the following sections we focus on the non-scalar complexity of comparison circuits.

% Let $\F_\fieldcard$ be a finite field of characteristic $\fieldchar$.
% We define the multiplicative map $\princhar_\fieldcard: \F_\fieldcard \rightarrow \{0,1\}, x \mapsto x^{\fieldcard-1} \mod \fieldchar$, which is called the \emph{principal character}.
% Due to Euler's theorem, $\princhar_\fieldcard(0) = 0$ and $\princhar_\fieldcard(x) = 1$ for any $x \in \F_\fieldcard^\times$.
